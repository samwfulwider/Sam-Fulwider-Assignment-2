# Assignment 2

Monday April 21<sup>st</sup> 5:45 PM

For this assignment you are creating a unit converter. All of the html and css is already created for you, the only thing you need to do is finish the `userInputHandler` function.

The `userInputHandler` will get called every time the user types and when the types change.

## Before starting the assignment make sure that:
<ul>
    <li>Accept the assignment 2.</li>
    <li>Clone your assignment repo to your computer. (When cloning there is no need to set upstream)</li>
    <li>The only thing you need to do is <code>git clone URL-OF-REPO</code> into the folder where you want the repo.</li>
</ul>

## In order to receive full credit you must make sure that:
<ul>
    <li>The value the user provided is a number, if not notify the user using the `showMessage()` function.</li>
    <li>Your code must work for floats and integers.</li>
    <li>Make sure that <code>updateValue</code> does not throw any errors.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the message is removed if the input is correct.</li>
    <li>Check what conversion we are doing (cm -> in or in -> cm)</li>
    <li>Calculate the correct value based on the unit conversion 1 in = 2.54 cm</li>
    <li>Update the value using the <code>updateValue</code></li>
</ul>

## For extra credit:
 <ul>
    <li>Format the output to 2 decimal places (1.00)
 </ul>
